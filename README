This tool aims to be a thin wrapper over AWS APIs. It's main development focus
is on deployment scenarios, and translating API calls to a declarative syntax
that can be maintained in version control. Extensions to the AWS APIs currently
focus on integration and extension of CloudInit functionality.

It is still very early in the development and some ideas are maturing. Expect
changes on a whim and the ability to influence the project's direction (until I
say no, that is :-p -- Jo√£o)

For now, hc2000 exposes a mostly seamless interface to running isolated
instances, spot-priced instances, launch configurations and auto-scaling groups
with scheduled activities.

Look at the examples, the --help option and try to avoid the code for now ;-)
